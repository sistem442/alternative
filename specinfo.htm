<strong>Academic Film Center of the &ldquo;Students&rsquo; City&rdquo; Cultural Center </strong></p>
<p class="style4"> Academic cine club was established on April 4 1958 (initiated by Predrag &#268;onki&#263;) as an alternative to, at the time prestigious Cine club Beograd. It was joint to the &ldquo;Students&rsquo; City&rdquo; Cultural Center (SCCC) in 1976., and later it changed the name into Academic Film Center. Through its 50 years history, thanks to the authors who created within the center&rsquo;s activity, it became one of the most significant and most awarded clubs in the country. Except for the production, the importance of the Center is reflected in its educational activity with young people through film and video workshops, screenings, talks and discussions about film, also in organization of festival of experimental film STAF (Study of authentic film, 1967-1970) and Alternative film/video (1982-1990, re-established in 2003), and also European animated film festival Balkanima (established in 2004). </p>
<p class="style4"> More than 800 films produced in the Center, as well as several thousand alternative films and video pieces produced by other authors is preserved in the Archive of alternative film and video in SCCC. The Center is today a place of gathering of students and young people for whom film and digital arts are a form of artistic expression and communication. </p>

<p class="style4"> The initial reason for the student rebellion in Students&rsquo; City in Belgrade in June 1968 was the incident at the entrance of the only cultural institution at the time in New Belgrade: Workers&rsquo; University, (students were stopped from attending a pop music show). In the analysis of the influence and consequences of this protest, there are two cultural institutions in Belgrade which were given to the students after the protests: Students&rsquo; Cultural Center (formerly a building in the center of Belgrade which housed State Security forces) and the &ldquo;Students&rsquo; City&rdquo; Cultural Center (built in the 1970&rsquo;s as an example of a modern cultural center). This indicative &ldquo;translation&rdquo; of the political requests into the cultural infrastructure symbolically marked future comprehension of these protests through their influence in cultural domain. The specificity of Yugoslav protests in 1968 in a global context, as well as the influence of this event on the later development of society and culture, demands serious research. Marking the 40 th anniversary of the protests in Belgrade, in Students&rsquo; City, contributes to a wider project of the historicization of this period in Yugoslav society and development of the Belgrade art scene, including the &ldquo;Black Wave&rdquo; in cinema. The manifest in Students&rsquo; City in the period of June 6-8, 2008 was designed to offer information about the ideas and consequences of the protests to the new generation of students, and also to remind them of the forgotten concept of youth as the &ldquo;progressive force of the society&rdquo;, especially of the social responsibility and engagement of the students. </p>

<p> <strong class="style1">Martijn Veldhoen</strong> <span class="style4">(Amsterdam, 1962) studied painting at the Rietveld Academy in Amsterdam from 1979 until 1984. From the start of his career, Veldhoen has been involved in many multidisciplinary projects that incorporated various disciplines such as music, sculptural objects, and later on, video and film. In 1992 Veldhoen started making videoinstalltions, and exhibited in 1994 at the Montevideo/Rene Coelho Gallery ( Amsterdam, The Netherlands) and in 1995 at the DotCom gallery during the Soho Arts Festival in ( New York, USA). His video installation 'Dislocations' (1998) was exhibited in France (Marseille and Hirouville) and Germany ( Dortmund and Berlin), and was nominated for the international media art price of ZDF/Arte and the ZKM (Zentrum fur Kunst und Medientechnologie, Karlsruhe, Germany).&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class="style4"> In recent years, Veldhoen started working on projects that can both be interpreted as video installations as well as experimental short films. These projects have been shown worldwide on exhibitions, film festivals and video festivals. 'Momentum' (2003) was nominated for a 'Golden Calf' for the best short film at the Dutch Film Festival Utrecht, and has won the first prize at the SENEF festival in Seoul and at the exhibition &lsquo;Crysalis&rsquo; in Bari, Italy. His second short film &lsquo;Forward&rsquo; (2004) has won the Grand Prix at the Split Filmfestival ( Croatia).&nbsp; </p>
<p class="style4"> 'Public Spaces' (2006) is Veldhoen's last filmproject; it has participated in several exhibitions in Holland ( Brabants Museum) and Russia ( St Petersburg and Moscow). Recently it received the Sphinx award at the Videomedeja Festival in Novi Sad. At this moment Veldhoen works on his most recent short film 'RE-constructions'. </p>

    <strong>The Victory over the Coup</strong></span><br>
    <strong>&nbsp;</strong><br>
    <span class="style4">Project authors: Chto Delat? &mdash; Olga Egorova (Tsaplya); <br>
  Dmitry Vilensky; Natalia Pershina (Gliuklya); Nikolai Oleinikov<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Our project deals with a key episode during perestroika in the Soviet Union. The action of the film unfolds on August 21, 1991, after the victory over the restorationist coup. On this day of unprecedented popular uplift it seemed that democracy had won a final victory in our country and that the people should and would be able to build a new, just society. How did our heroes see that society? This is the question we try to answer in our film.The film is structured like an ancient tragedy: its dramatis personae are divided into a chorus and a group of five heroes. Our heroes are key types generated by the perestroika era, each of them with a particular vision of his/her role in history: a democrat, a businessman, a revolutionary, a nationalist, and a feminist. They act and they dream. They analyze their actions, their place in society, and their vision of the country&rsquo;s political path. The chorus is the incarnation of public opinion. It makes moral judgments on our heroes and it foresees their futures, as if it were gazing on the proceedings from the present day. </span></p>
<p class="style4">Our film analyzes the spec ific configuration of forces during this supremely important historical moment of contemporary history. It critiques political na&iuml;vet&eacute; while also showing how difficult it is for people to realize their vision of the future together. </p>
<p class="style4"> then about chronicles<br>
  <br>
  The film Chronicles of Perestroyka is based on the documentation of different manifestation at the time of Perestroyka from 1987 till 1991 in Petersburg. The materials are generously provided by the Saint Petersburg Studio of Documentary Films<br>
Special thanks to all camera men who preserved these unique moments of history and to Sergey Gelver, who has saved and is taking care of these precious materials. </p>

    </strong><br>
    <span class="style4">Founded in early 2003 in Petersburg, the platform &quot;Chto delat?/What is to be done?&quot; opens space inspired by the need of merging of political theory, art, and activism. The platform's work is coordinated by a workgroup of the same name: its members include artists, critics, philosophers, and writers from Petersburg and Moscow. (see full list at website www.chtodelat.org)<br>
&nbsp;<br>
The activity of the platform is realised in a variety of art projects and seminars, including videoworks, installations, public actions, radio programs, artistic examinations of urban space and everyday.<br>
<br>
Chto delat has been publishing an English-Russian newspaper on issues central to engaged culture, based on alternative research methods with the focus on a repoliticization of Russian cultural situation in a dialogue with <br>
international context. These newspapers are usually produced in the framework of self-organised collective initiatives such as art projects, educational seminars or activist campaigns. </span></p>

Our objective is to produce, stimulate and mediate innovative artistic and interpretative practices and to encourage international links between them. We provide the participants and users of contemporary art with knowledge, tools and skills necessary for emancipated and reflected operation within the art system. By establishing a support system and cooperating with numerous NGOs we situate artistic practices into the social framework. </span></p>

<p class="style4"> On June 19th, 1995, New York-born artist Al Hansen died in his studio in Cologne. It wasn&rsquo; t usual for Hansen to disappear, and his body laid undiscovered for some time. He was found under his desk, smothered in what many consider trash, but what he called working materials. He was 67 years old, and working on a collage made out of matchsticks. </p>
<p class="style4"> &bdquo;The Matchstick Traveller&ldquo; portrays an artist who was many things simultaneously: beat poet, pop artist, performer, Fluxus artist, author, porn editor, actor, composer, punk band manager &ndash; an axis for all post-war movements, and still an outcast. The film looks back at his chaotic life, and examines the notion of failure. </p>
<p class="style4"> It is a documentary collage that interweaves remarkable archival footage with the thoughts and memories of those who were there, featuring appearances by Fluxus artists Ben Vautier, Alison Knowles, Larry Miller, Ben Patterson, the Vienna actionist Hermann Nitsch, and Hansen&rsquo;s friends and family. </p>
