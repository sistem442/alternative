Strangers pulled him to safety, giving him a second chance at life and propelling him on the epic journey of mind, body, and spirit that has become the feature documentary THE SKIN Iâ€™M IN.\r\n\r\nThe film is at once personal and universal in its address of bodily shame, addiction, creativity, and the search for self and spirit in a rapidly globalizing and accelerating world. Spanning Germany, Canada, Japan, Kenya, and the United States, Foxâ€™s journey to unite mind, body, and spirit includes collaboration with Canadian First-Nations artist Rande Cook and African-American tattoo artist Zulu, who help him memorialize his experiences in a full back tattoo. The documentary uses this physical transformation as the departure point and thread for Foxâ€™s story of bodily abuse, experimentation, and redemption. \r\n\r\nWith penetrating but disarming candor, Fox invites all of us, regardless of age, gender, sexuality, race, or background to actively explore the world and continue to challenge ourselves rather than simply accept the status quo.',9,'prijave/2011/slike/1340062810.jpeg','prijave/2011/slike/1340062811.jpeg','prijave/2011/slike/1340062812.jpeg','Broderick spent several childhood years in Tokyo and his twenties between Berlin and Los Angeles, making his creative perspective markedly international.

The aim is to incite the explosion of a closed system through a dispositive of audiovisual implosions. Forget what you see while you are actually watching it, and soak in a vibrating, optical ancestry. A scream without a reason.\r\n\r\nThe human eye can see the world through photoreceptive cells on the retina, a membrane sensitive to light emitted or reflected by objects. Light travels through time and space at a certain speed. For example, sunlight takes 8 minutes to get to our eyes, while from other stars it takes several lightyears. Also the light generated or reflected by an object or a person on Earth takes a certain time, even if short and infinitesimal. There is a distance (short, eternal) between us and our image of reality. Even between thought and action, between thought and language, there is a similar lapse, necessary to transmit the signal via electrical impulses from the brain to different parts of the body.\r\n\r\nâ€œMiss Candace Hilligoss\' flickering haloâ€ is a film about this distance, about the interval simultaneously separating and uniting, the silence between words, the black between pictures. It \'s a film against the dialectical opposites in cinema, assembled according to the Heisenberg\'s uncertainty principle and the use of the phenomenon of retinal persistence as an expressive tool. Vincenzo Core, sound director, believes the audio element is not just a naturalistic comment of pictures, but rather a counterpoint between sound and images able to turn the experience into a real \"audiovision \".',41,'prijave/2011/slike/1343589060.jpeg','prijave/2011/slike/1343589061.jpeg','prijave/2011/slike/1343589062.jpeg','Fabio Scacchioli was born in Teramo in 1979.

Some of the participants in this film lived through this terrible experience personally.\r\nRajif BegiÄ‡, the witness, plays himself in this film. Through his strong will, commitment and courage he testified at the Haag tribunal committee and the Superior Court of Bosnia-Herzegovina against the Serbian war criminals.\r\nOn May 31, 1992, the Tschetniks invaded and took control of the village of BegiÄ‡i and the neighboring villages. All the men were assembled and forced to march toward the Vrhpolje bridge. On the way to the bridge, some of his neighbors and his younger brother were killed in cold blood by Jadranko Palija. The men were forced into lines on the bridge and one after the other assassinated. They were forced to jump off the bridge into the river. Once in the water, they were shot by the Tschetniks.\r\nIn December 1994, the International Criminal Court for former Yugoslavia took the case and filed 161 indictments.\r\nIt was not until 2011 that the last two of those war criminals were captured in Serbia! Ratko MladiÄ‡, the most wanted war criminal in Europe, was caught on the 26th of May and Goran HadÅ¾iÄ‡ on the 20th of July.',43,'prijave/2011/slike/1343841107.jpeg','prijave/2011/slike/1343841108.jpeg','prijave/2011/slike/1343841109.jpeg','MOST â€“ THE BRIDGE (based on true events) was my first film (short film).

We donâ€™t need books anymore, we need a device for live performance, for the ephemeral moment that will nonetheless stay in the audienceâ€™s mind only after the live recital. Ephemeral is then, not so ephemeral anymore. Technology, experimentation, interaction, freedom. A new oral method that brings back the link between poetry and audience thanks to a hybridization of means that will turn the poem into action.  \r\nLike polypoetry does, â€˜Out of the pageâ€™ mixes any reachable mean to provoke, to shake, to emotion the audience. From shouting to abstraction, everything is valid, from the detail and the gesture until the visceral face to face.

The city, as a living organism, reflecting social processes and interactions, economic relations, political conditions and private matters.\r\nIn the city, human memories, desires and tragedies find expression in the form of designations and marks engraved in house walls and paving slabs. But what the city really is under this thick layer of signs, what it contains or conceals, is what we are researching in the HIDDEN CITIES project.\r\nThe source material for the film are 9 sequential photo works created by GusztÃ¡v HÃ¡mos between 1975 and 2010.

Seated at the table Musil revealed that they were going to summon the ghost of Frans Anton Mesmer, discoverer of animal magnetism and forefather of hypnosis.  Musil told Freud about a series of dreams he had which involved a talking flea.  Musil, who had secretly become a follower of the imaginationist school of animal magnetism wanted to question Mesmer as to the meaning of these dreams, in which said flea foretold of impending catastrophes all over Europe.  It is said that Mesmer obligingly appeared and spoke in a repetitive and oblique manner.  Mesmerâ€™s words were transcribed by Freud in several scraps of paper and hidden separately in a series of objects that, owing to the vicissitudes of history, would end up in the collections of three Viennese museums. Legend has it that he who could piece together the text would find instructions for the construction of a film; a film about a distinguished man. \r\nWe visited these museums and unable to break away the objects from their glass prisons have made an attempt to reconstruct this film hoping that the magnetic force in the objects themselves would transfer to the silver halide crystals on the film surface allowing us to make sense of a sentence which we know is the single written testimony left over from the sÃ©ance. Found in her dairy as the lone entry for that date, Eugenie Schwarzwald, the only other known participant wrote: â€œA distinguished flea hypnotizes the ghost of a distinguished man.â€',170,'prijave/2011/slike/1349166195.jpeg','prijave/2011/slike/1349166196.jpeg','prijave/2011/slike/1349166197.jpeg','Anja Dornieden and Juan David GonzÃ¡lez Monroy are filmmakers living and working in Berlin.

Lena is the 15-year-old daughter who can move fluidly in either the US or Mexico, seemingly comfortable in her identity as a Mexican country girl.

She attempts to return it to normal â€“ meeting with Sam to test his feelings for her â€“ but soon realises that doubt, once seeded, is not so easy to uproot.\r\n\r\nTaking place over a 24-hour period, the film captures Lauraâ€™s uncertain state of mind and shows how quickly we feel destabilised when trust has been undermined.

The place is infamous for two things- the presence of armed Maoist Rebels who are fighting against the Government and poverty. The living condition in the village is pathetic and the people are being exploited from different corners.  The Government signs one MOU after another with companies who want to exploit the natural resources in Chhattisgarh. To add to the troubles of the villagers, the armed forces arrive there to tackle the insurgent crisis and to annihilate the rebels. Torn between the two forces are the people in the village.  \r\n\r\nThe curfew, imposed in the village after the battle between the Maoists and the Army started, has been lifted. The market place is deserted except one man, the Barber who is sitting on the bench in front of his shop. Slowly people start emerging to the market. Three of them comes to the barbershop and discuss the state of affairs in the village at the barbershop. The encounter that happened in the forest closer to the village has just got over and the leader of the rebels has been killed along with several others.  \r\n\r\nSoon enough, taking the men by surprise, the Captain of the armed forces appears in the scene and asks the Barber for a shave. The Barber, who is a sympathizer of the rebels, is thrown into a dilemma getting the Captain unarmed in the chair right at the tip of the shaving blade. He could kill him easily or complete his job of giving a good shave. Hiding his emotions he commences his job. As the shave progresses the Captain narrates how he killed the rebels and tortured some of them, intensifying the Barberâ€™s inner conflict.  \r\n\r\nThe shave progresses. Barber ends up giving a perfect shave to the Captain. The Captain praises him for that. As he leaves the shop the Captain reveals the game he played- he had information that the Barber might try to kill him. He came to teach the Barber that killing is not that easy. \r\n\r\nThe Barber retorts. He had acquired the skill from his ancestors. The lesson they gave him is that a good barber will never have blood in his hands.

There is one ghetto condemned to something even worse: it has forgotten its music.  Itâ€™s The Fountain, in the heart of the city: once a vibrant community, where people used to dance together despite religious differences, now a disappearing Protestant neighborhood killed by fear and politics and turned into an open air prison, now living behind a fence. \r\nRoy Arbuckle, a musical troubadour, decides itâ€™s time to challenge one of the monstrosities left by the war in Northern Ireland: fear. He wants to reunite his former showband, The Signetts and his formers musicians, nowadays in their seventies, that lived the heady glamour of the Show band era, in a high-risk attempt to try to do something that would be normal anywhere else but not yet in Northern Ireland: having a major dance night, inviting their old enemies and get Protestants and Catholics dancing together. If it wasnâ€™t enough, for this event Roy wants to open up the stronghold of Protestant heritage and culture in Derry: the Memorial Hall, once the most popular dance hall in the heart of the city. \r\nA colorful, melancholic and ironic musical journey through a ghetto that, even if it find itself in its last dance, it doesnâ€™t want to miss a single step of it.',199,'prijave/2011/slike/1349414660.jpeg','prijave/2011/slike/1349414661.jpeg','prijave/2011/slike/1349414662.jpeg','Italian film director and poet.

Aus seiner Sicht stehen diese riesigen Transportwerkzeuge im engsten mechanischem, akustischem und optischen Zusammenklang mit seinen â€žbewegtenâ€œ analogen Filmbildern. Als Fortsetzung dieser Analogie funktioniert â€žMotorâ€œ aus einer Kapitelfolge von einzelnen HafenschauplÃ¤tzen in Westfrankreich an denen die mechanische Kameraaufzeichnung ihren hypnotischen Lauf nimmt.\r\nFÃ¼r die Tongestaltung benutzt Andreas Gogol analog erzeugte Klangstrukturen und assoziiert frei in die akustischen RÃ¤ume. Auch wenn Ton und Bild von â€žMOTORâ€œ alleine stehen kÃ¶nnen, so ist Eins plus Eins in dieser weiteren Zusammenarbeit Drei.\r\nâ€žMOTORâ€œ ist auch eine Fortsetzung der Filmperformance â€žLANDED TAKES & SOUND TIMESâ€œ fÃ¼r die Andreas Gogol und Telemach Wiesinger mit dem TEAM WORK AWARD beim 20. Stuttgarter Filmwinter (2007) ausgezeichnet wurden.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn his filmpoem \"PASSAGE\", Wiesinger already choreographed \"moving\" bridges. From his point of view, this means of transportation is mechanically, acustically and optically closely connected with his analogousÂ  filmpictures in motion. As a continuation of this analogy, \"MOTOR\" works as a sequence of several different habour settings in the West of France, where the mechanical process of filming takes place. For the sound Andreas Gogol uses analogously produced soundÂ  structures and freely associates into the acustic spaces. Even though sound and image of \"MOTOR\" can exist alone, one and one in the ongoing teamwork is three, not two...\r\n\"MOTOR\" is also a continuation of the film performance \" Landed Takes & Sound Times\" for which Andreas Gogol and Telemach Wiesinger won the team work award in the 20th \"Stuttgarter Filmwinter\"( 2007).Â \r\n\r\n\r\nDÃ©jÃ  dans son PoÃ¨me filmÃ© \"Passage\" (2008), Telemach Wiesinger chorÃ©graphie des ponts tournants, basculants ou pont-levis . De son point de vue, ces immenses outils de Transport sont dans un lien mÃ©canique, acoustique et optique des plus Ã©troits avec ses images animÃ©es analogiques. En tant que poursuite de cette analogie, \"Motor\" fonctionne comme une suite de chapitres de lieux portuaires dans l\'ouest de la France, oÃ¹ l\'enregistrement mÃ©canique de la camÃ©ra prend sa course hypnotique.\r\nPour la crÃ©ation sonore, Andreas Gogol utilise des structures sonores analogiques et les associe librement dans les espaces acoustiques. MÃªme si son et image de \"Motor\" peuvent exister l\'un sans l\'autre,Â l\'addition,Â dans cette collaboration,Â de un plus un donne trois.\r\n\"Motor\" est Ã©galement une poursuite de la performance cinÃ©matographique \"Landed Takes & Sound Times\", pour laquelle Andreas Gogol et Telemach Wiesinger ont Ã©tÃ© rÃ©compensÃ© avec le Team Work Award, au 20iÃ¨me Hiver CinÃ©matographique de Stuttgart en 2007.\r\n\r\n\r\nEn el poema cinematogrÃ¡fico de 2008, \"PASSAGE\" (\"PASAJE\"), Wiesinger ya habÃ­a centrado su interÃ©s en puentes giratorios y elevadizos. Desde su punto de vista estos instrumentos gigantescos de transporte estÃ¡n Ã­ntimamente relacionados mecÃ¡nica-, acÃºstica- y Ã³pticamente con sus imÃ¡genes anÃ¡logas en movimiento. Este equivalente persiste en \"Motor\" que muestra varios capÃ­tulos de tomas de puertos en el oeste de Francia, en los cuales la cÃ¡mara mecÃ¡nica toma su camino hipnÃ³tico.\r\nPara el sonido Andreas Gogol utiliza estructuras de sonido anÃ¡logas las que asocia libremente en los espacios acÃºsticos. Si bien es cierto que la imagen y el sonido de \"MOTOR\" pueden estar separados, en el caso de esta cooperaciÃ³n la suma de uno mas uno son tres. \r\n\"MOTOR\" a la vez sigue la linea del Performance cinematogrÃ¡fico \"LANDED TAKES AND SOUND\" con la cual Andreas Gogol y Telemach Wiesinger recibieron en 2007 el TEAM WORK AWARD en el \"vigÃ©simoÂ invierno cinematografico de Stuttgart\" (\"20.

One could even say that it tells a trite story insofar as, especially last year, numerous mass media eagerly chewed and sucked on it only to be able to spit it out and let it sink into oblivion with an easy conscience. In this sense, the fate of this story, which In the Land of the Bears has picked up, shares the fate of its â€œsubjectâ€: the seasonal workers from Bosnia and Herzegovina, whom, with a promise of quick and substantial earnings, Slovenia ground and sucked dry only to spit them out with an easy conscience, underpaid and unpaid, leaving them forgotten and without any rights. In the Land of the Bears is somewhat ironically named after a sign greeting â€œtouristsâ€ at the border crossing Petrina ob KoÄevju, which is, among other things, the seat of one of the more infamous exploitative organisations and a place that, in certain parts of BiH, is now more than with anything else â€“ for example bears â€“ associated with a labour camp. With this gesture, explained in the second part of the film by one of the cheated protagonists, In the Land of the Bears dispenses with every kind of irony and similar strategies of establishing a distance. Its first and main strong point is the fundamental strong point of the best documentary cinema: personal affection and the consequent engagement â€“ although we have to be very careful and precise in using this concept in the given situation. Nika Autorâ€™s film does not boast an engagement that would activistically cut into a difficult situation, try to change it or call to resistance. For the story is, at least for the most part, already finished; the resistance was quenched even before it managed to flare up; the defeat recognised and acknowledged, but therefore turned into an experience. What is at stake is another, subtler and consequently perhaps also more effective form of engagement that calls especially to the following: the sharpening of the gaze. It would be somewhat risky to claim that such a sharpening of the gaze is possible only after the initial passions have subsided and the dimension of a cheap spectacle, as staged by the aforementioned mass media, has been pushed into the past and entirely thwarted. But without any doubt, this sharpening of the gaze brings what the momentary activist intervention and spectacle will not or cannot: it gives a voice, a name and a history to the formerly voiceless, nameless and fleeting object of exploitation, it allows for the emergence of the subject in all the meanings of this concept. In order to reveal (her and consequently our) anger, empathy and reflection regarding one of the symptomatic and neuralgic points of contemporary capitalism, Nika Autor does not extend her gaze over the horizon, the surging masses, protest speeches and objections, but focuses wholly on one land, the land of the bears, and especially one individual, her friend Armin SalihoviÄ‡, whose particular story thus becomes the most effective metaphor for the universal one. The camera is in her hand and close (where it should be), the editing true to the moment (which makes the film full of suspense), the viewers navigate the story themselves without any explanatory interventions (e.g., the filmmakerâ€™s commentary) or emotional manipulations (e.g., music) and are therefore respected (and can respect others themselves). Precisely herein â€“ and hardly anywhere else â€“ lies not only the future of solidarity in the land of the bears, but also the future of documentary cinema.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nJurij Meden',219,'prijave/2011/slike/1349865400.jpeg','prijave/2011/slike/1349865401.jpeg','prijave/2011/slike/1349865402.jpeg','-Postcards,9\', 2010\r\n- Report on a situation of asylum seekers in Republic of Slovenia, January 2008 August 2009,Nika Autor& Maja Cimerman, 36\', 2010\r\n-Solidarity, 6\', 2011\r\n-In the land of bears, 72\', 2012','Tue, 09 Oct 2012 16:58:40 +020'),('Solidarnost ','Solidarity','Nika Autor','Slovenija','jugoslavia',2012,'6','dvd ','/','/','Nika Autor','/','/','/','IRZU','Vodnikova 28, 1000 Ljubljana','','','nika.autor@avtonomija.org','Nika Autor','','','nika.autor@avtonomija.org','The film is a reshot of the 1973 movie Solidarity by Joyce Wieland.

In fact the first LumiÃ¨re brothers film \"Workers Leaving the Factory\" from 1895 has often been credited as the first motion picture ever made. In the 20th century also many experimental filmmakers depicted the rat race of modern life in their own way. Such films include for example \"Manhatta\" (1921) by Paul Strand, \"By Night with Torch and Spear\" (1940s) by Joseph Cornell and \"Necrology\" (1969-1970) by Standish Lavender. \"Smokestacks, Below\" continues the same tradition.\r\n\r\n\"Smokestacks, Below\" shows the darker and harsher side of industrial environment. The overall mood of the found footage based film is somewhat gloomy. Both the editing and the audio track also reflect repetitive mechanical patterns, which underline the lack of human touch. The factory is no longer a dynamic futuristic powerhouse but an alienating, decayed surrounding filled with lifeless automation.\r\n\r\nThis film is the second part of two-film series describing factory work. The two films of the series \"Men at Work\" (2010-2012) and \"Smokestacks, Below\" (2012) have been compiled from the same found footage material.

It is impossible not to feel an intense emotional response when exposed to Zownir\'s work. He is one of those rare artists whose empathy burns through his images, championing misfits and dreamers who live out their lives a long way beneath the radar of \"acceptable\" society - just in between the blank spaces of the newspaper obituaries, and the dark shadows of the tenement housing blocks.\"\r\n(DAZED & CONFUSED)\r\nPHOTOGRAPHY\r\nHailed by Terry Southern as the \"Poet of Radical Photography\" Miron Zownir\'s photographic work has been exhibited in galleries and museums in several countries from 1981 on. Some of his photographs were shown amongst artworks of the likes of Goya, Picasso, Alfred Kubin and Cindy Sherman in the exhibition â€˜El salvaie europeoâ€™ (2004) in Barcelona and Valencia. \r\nIn autumn 2008 Zownirâ€™s photography was presented by the Fotomuseum Winterthur (CH) along with works of photographers like Robert Mapplethorpe, Man Ray, Nan Goldin, Larry Clark, Andy Warhol, Nobuyoshi Araki and others in DARKSIDE I, an outstanding exhibition which showcased a remarkable collection of photography that is dedicated to images of sexuality as a mostly central part of our existence. \r\nFollowing Darkside I, the Fotomuseum Winterthur again presented Zownirâ€™s work in Darkside II (2009) exploring the photographed human body as victim of impairment, disease, degeneration, violence and death with works by W. Eugene Smith, Weegee, Robert Capa, Don Mc Cullin and others.\r\n\r\nZownir took up photography in the late 70s during the hey-days of the punk-phenomenon in West- Berlin and London, delivering a tight portrayal of the movement and its peculiar attitude towards life in limbo between a utopian vision of anarchy and nihilistic self-destruction. \r\nIn 1980, Miron Zownir emigrated to the USA, where he lived for the next fifteen years; first in New York, then in Los Angeles, and Pittsburgh. In New York, back then arguably the world\'s most fascinating and permissive metropolis, Zownir\'s peculiar approach to cover the city\'s multiple-layered day-to-day lunacy was quickly recognised by the local scene as the TEUTONIC PHENOMENOGRAPHER (Village Voice). Shot in moody, expressionistic b/w, Zownir\'s pictures from that period give a penetrating insight to inner-city sub-cultural spheres, which, in their original local context, have since perished in the boom of the 90s. His lens captured the untamed lust at the gay-parties, just shortly before Aids massively claimed its victims; the futile protest of artists and offbeat performers; the hopelessness on the Bowery; the shadowy world of hookers or junkies. \r\nZownir\'s photographs of the \'Sex Piers\' have become legendary documents by now. The shut-down and dilapidated port area located between the Westside Highway and the Hudson River, with its sunbathing section for nudists and the surrounding \'halls of the anonymous lust\', was a popular meeting place among the gay- scene.\r\nZownir meanwhile has gained the reputation of being one of the most uncompromising contemporary photographers. Some critics claim that Zownir, in his own characteristic manner, ties on where Diane Arbus and Weegee had stopped. But when it comes to the basis of his artistic intention, Miron Zownir would rather point to a quote from Kafkaâ€™s â€˜The Castleâ€™ then being compared to other photographers: â€œIf one has the strength to look at the things incessantly, more or less without ever closing the eyes, one sees much. But if one lessens the effort only once and closes the eyes, it all immediately vanishes into darkness.â€\r\nIn summer 1995 Zownir traveled to Russia. Focused on street photography he took pictures of homeless, dying and dead people. According to Zownir, he experienced Moscow as â€œthe most aggressive and dangerous city Iâ€™ve ever been to.â€ Yet even Russian militia couldnâ€™t keep him away from depicting the blatant social and moral decline in the former Soviet Union. Zownirâ€™s images from Russia are bitter and brutal, and highly distressing to view. The human tragic of radical poverty, that they reveal, ultimately climaxes in the utterly undignified act of dying in public. â€œIt was Danteâ€™s inferno,â€ Zownir would state when he returned to Berlin after three months of a terrifying descend into the lower depths of the Post-Soviet society. \r\nHis photographs from Moscow and St. Petersburg had been published among 150 other works from 1979-1997 in RADICAL EYE â€“ THE PHOTOGRAPHY OF MIRON ZOWNIR (Gestalten Verlag, Berlin, 1997).  Zownirâ€™s focus on extreme subjects and extraordinary forms of the human condition continued to be the central motivation of his work. In the â€˜Holy Yearâ€™ 2000, he went to picture pilgrims in Lourdes and accompanied a fraternity of Christian flagellants in Spain. \r\nAnother photo book, THE VALLEY OF THE SHADOW (2010), was again published by Gestalten Verlag . â€œAs in life, there is simply no room for this kind of photography in traditional lifestyle media - or for Miron Zownirâ€™s chosen subjectsâ€, publisher Robert Klanten stated in his preface. â€œWhile mainstream photography has thrown off its original reportage mandate to become the vicarious agent of the advertising business â€“ glossy and glam, even in its grittier incarnations â€“ or to supply us with iconic images of historic events, with instant placeholders destined to become part of our collective memories and lore, Miron does not seek out such landmark visions or events, but prefers to hunt down personal obsessions and the inherent existential state of his protagonists.â€œ\r\nIn 2012 Zownir received the â€œGrenzgÃ¤ngerâ€- grant from the Robert Bosch Foundation, providing the possibility for him and the author and editor of Ukrainian art and literary magazine of social criticism \"Prostory\" Kateryna Mishchenko to start a photographic research throughout the Ukraine. A project that is called â€œOkraÑ—naâ€ (Outskirts) and realized in 2012/13.\r\n\r\nLITERATURE\r\nThe publication of the German language crime novel KEIN SCHLICHTER ABGANG (NO EASY WAY OUT) in 2003 marked Miron Zownir\'s debut as an author of noir-style fiction. A bizarre, gloomy pulp story, which was published as an original paperback by MirandA Verlag, known for their German editions of the works of Harry Crews, Lydia Lunch, Henry Rollins etc.\r\nWhen reading Zownirâ€™s debut novel it is not far to seek to ask oneself how much of Zownirâ€™s own life might be put in his first-person narrator, a failed script author named Roland Skollani,  who ends up as a debt collector...or vice versa.\r\nThe fact remains that Zownir experienced all the depths and abysses of daily survival as a debt collector in New York. Also in his two subsequent,so far unpublished novels THE FALSE SMILE OF THE SUN and LANA, with which Zownir completed a trilogy of thrillers within an American Hardcore Setup, one can easily find traces of the authorâ€™s life. \r\nLike Eddie, the main protagonist in THE FALSE SMILE OF THE SUN , who returns from the hapless fishing trip from Alaska to Seattle, completely broke and with his vocal chords ruined by vomiting, Zownir himself  worked  in the early 1990s on a rotten fishing cutter  and sailed for months through a fished out Bering Sea.  In Zownirâ€™s novel LANA he describes the unstoppable downward spiral of Landau, a former sketch artist at the Chicago police, who is turning into a life of crime to save his psychotic daughter from the nastily reality of Brooklyn and in the end loses his struggle for freedom.\r\n\r\nAs an author Zownir reports from abysmal landscapes of lost souls, and offers a vison and a perspective, that can only be taken by someone, who has seen a lot more than the usual and ordinary, but who also allows himself the creative freedom of a fictional  carrying on.\r\n\r\nHis main protagonists are drifting through downtowns, gutters and wastelands of American cities like NYC, LA, Seattle or Pittsburgh, cities in which Zownir himself lived restlessly for more than fifteen years. Whether in rundown apartments, stuffy nightclubs, swanky luxury apartments, hard benches, depressing motel rooms, on highways, depraved homeless shelters or the brutal open street itself - all places of the events are only way stations, where anyone can lose everything any minute... \r\nThe bourgeois, the misfits, the criminals, the police, the racists, the politically correct as well as the desperate or the optimists: Nobody is able to escape and no one achieve oneâ€™s ends...\r\nZownir plays around with clichÃ©s, in order to break them unexpectedly;  he shows uncompromising and defiant humor, not bowing to the choice of the masses, and let his heroes now and then search for a rest of unconsumed feelings and unsold dreams, for painkilling sparks of the senses,  that will still brighten even the darkest scenario.\r\n\r\nPARASITEN DER OHNMACHT a new book with 36 bizarre short stories and hard-boiled poetry as well as a selection of images from Zownirâ€™s recent photographic researches was published in autumn 2009 by mox&maritz Verlag.\r\nIn his short stories, poems and aphorisms Zownir combines the primary matter of aggression, obsession, sexuality, death, greed, loneliness, love, hate, eating and -be-eaten in an explosive sum, that  rips all literary conventions and catapults the reader into insane visions and a perverted present world . Or brings him down to earth with naked, painful facts and a big bang.\r\nThe book will be translated into Bulgarian (supported by Goethe Institut Sofia) and published by Black Flamingo Publishing, Sofia.\r\n13 short stories and poems out of this book were read by actor Birol Ãœnel (Head On, Soulkitchen)  for the German language audiobook  BIROL ÃœNEL LIEST MIRON ZOWNIR- PARASITEN DER OHNMACHT released by  Deutsche Grammophon / Universal . The congenial soundtrack was composed by FM Einheit (ex-EinstÃ¼rzende Neubauten).\r\n    \r\nDuring his residence in America Zownir had not only worked as a photographer but also ventured into filmmaking. He wrote and directed several underground short films, working mainly with producer Chosei Funahara, a founding member of legendary NYC band Plasmatics. Another of Zownir\'s collaborators on these films, as director of photography, was Alexander Rockwell, who would go on to direct the films â€œIn The Soupâ€ and â€Four Roomsâ€. Zownir also developed a series of film exposÃ©s for the Japanese author and director Ryu Murakami (â€œTokyo Decadenceâ€).\r\nThe first two short films Zownir shot in Germany were SKINHEAD LANE (1993), an anti-racism spot, and NOW OR NEVER (1996). He directed the documentary BRUNO S. - ESTRANGEMENT IS DEATH (2003), a feature-length portrayal of Bruno S., the street musician, painter who found fame as the protagonist of Werner Herzog\'s â€žThe Enigma of Kaspar Hauserâ€œ and â€žStroczekâ€œ. The film debuted at the International Film Festival Berlin in 2003 and was shown at numerous other film festivals around the world.\r\nIn 2006, Zownir directed VALUEV VS VIOLENCE, a spot against violence, in which Nikolai Valuev, the Russian boxer and heavyweight champion gives his opinion on the topic of aggression. The soundtrack was contributed by Alexander Hacke, known as member of the legendary German industrial band EinstÃ¼rzende Neubauten. \r\nZownirâ€™s full length film PHANTOMANIE features forgotten performers like Bruno S., shortly before he died, renowned German actors like Natalia Avelon, Hans Michael Rehberg or Geno Lechner aswell as Berlin underground musicians like Gina D\'Dorio (Cobra Killer) and Rummelsnuff. The soundtrack for PHANTOMANIE was performed and produced by Alec Empire.  He then directed the music video FREIER FALL for Rummelsnuff (2010), and a short film called FUCK UP (2012), starring Birol Ãœnel, Timo Jacobs, Milton Welsh, Natalia Avelon and others with music by King Khan.','Thu, 11 Oct 2012 11:44:39 +020'),('Eimai Anthropos ','I am Human','Michalis Lygkiaris','Greece','international',2012,'3:28','dvd ','Michalis Lygkiaris','Michalis Lygkiaris','Michalis Lygkiaris','Antonis Karagiannis and others','Michalis Lygkiaris','','Scarlet Web','Tzoumagias 67','+30 6972605166','','scarletwebfilms@gmail.com','Michalis Lygkiaris','+30 6972605166','','scarletwebfilms@gmail.com','A collage of people who seem to have nothing in common, in a world where a characterization seems enough to describe them.',236,'prijave/2011/slike/1349987302.jpeg','prijave/2011/slike/1349987303.jpeg','prijave/2011/slike/1349987304.jpeg','Michalis Lygkiaris was born in Athens in 1982.

Whereas photographs grab a moment out of the life of living (human) beings, as a result of which these remain ever dead within the grabbed and lifeless moment, film is supposed to capture  life in its flux, in its movement. It is not very hard to realize that this distinction concerns either an argument based on false analogy, or our falling for a rather transparent magicianâ€™s trick. The very fact that a film follows our movement and thereby is analogous to that lively movement does not mean that film is able to capture â€˜lifeâ€™ as opposed to â€˜deathâ€™. Technically speaking, film allows us to manipulate the viewerâ€™s experience in such a way that grabbed moments of death appear to be the flux of living. It is both this false analogy or the trick of a skilled magician that Pointekerâ€™s work is able to avoid because it is an intense exploration of the notion of time.\r\nIf time stops, a living being is dead; but what is time? In terms of physics, the latest insight is that time is the click-wise (one would be tempted to say clock-wise) transition of one quantum-state of affairs to the other. In terms of narrative this would mean that time is defined in terms of the event, as a change of situation: First you are alive, then you are dead. \r\nIf this is the case, then time, really, is the moment of change. Time concerns the very moment at \r\nwhich the situation is on the verge of changing, or in the moment of changing. It is this moment that Ben Pointeker wants to capture â€“ no, that is not possible. Having captured it, life will have shifted to death. The moment of change is the moment that Pointeker wants to â€˜en-liveâ€™ in his work of art. \r\nThe â€˜momentousâ€™ quality of Pointekerâ€™s work is emphasized by a tension between two modes of â€˜passing timeâ€™. On the one hand  there is the side of a mountain that has been inscribed by time. In a sense the mountain side is a text that invites us to read time, and as such the image is stable, as a text that is to be read and that can be reread. The mountainside embodies the depth of time. At the other side there is the glimpse of a moment. The sun has been rising and very briefly one specific spot of the mountainside was enlightened as an orange triangle. You would have to have been there. It is a glimpse, nothing more. The orange triangle embodies the momentous flux and impossible grasp-ability of time. \r\nIn-between this depth and  flux there are two human beings, perhaps there were three (did you see the third one?). They live on the verge of living and dying, in the state of changing from one state into another. If we connect to them, we embody the tremor of time, as they do. Nothing happens. We are simply on the verge of living and dying. \r\nThis is why Pointekerâ€™s work is momentous, and as a result it is almost ungraspable.

REHEARSALS is referring to the feature film BEDWAYS by RP KAHL and the search for possible ways of depicting sexuality in film and in art.\r\nFor REHEARSALS RP KAHL is undergoing an intimate self-experiment. In a staged rehearsal the three performers Marie GolÃ¼ke, Aline Mauch and RP Kahl act as the characters Marie, Nina and Hans from BEDWAYS, but at the same time as themselves without the protection of a part or any fictional level. In front of a small audience Kahl and his two comrades are creating a situation that could have been happening behind the scenes of the BEDWAYS production. How do you get into a sex scene? How do you initiate intimacy? How strongly do you have to merge in the moment, when does it become â€œrealâ€?\r\nRP Kahl creates a flickering hybrid of performance, documentatary and video art with feature film elements which allows the viewer to reflect, observe and to show empathy, but also to let his voyeurism run free, depending on his perspective.',287,'prijave/2011/slike/1350439468.jpeg','prijave/2011/slike/1350439469.jpeg','prijave/2011/slike/1350439470.jpeg','Born on november 8th 1970 in Cottbus.

The music of Beethoven gives the sad picture an ironic lightness.\r\nPeople walk past each other, but they are no longer connected to each other and their environment. It shows their stress, loneliness and isolation. The closeness and intimacy is abolished, just like the nature which is replaced by an artificial nature. We are constantly tired and live in a â€œfatigue society â€œ (Philosopher Byung-Chul Han). New information technologies dominate our daily life, they determine our being. The city people live away from nature and reality. They are non- stop on-line, they speak all the time but not with those who surrounds them.The virtual communication which promises us closeness and freedom is the one who actually destroys both. The human intimacy and the nature disappear, its a worldwide phenomena of our hightech societies.

In recent history, the area around the infamous Azadi Tower (Freedom Tower) has been the backdrop of various protests, demonstrations, and violent repression. The Iranian Revolution of 1979 and the nationalistic and patriotic demonstrations during the following Iran-Iraq War, or the aftermath of the 2009 presidential elections are part of our collective memory. \r\n\r\nAt the same time, the so called Arabic Spring determined life in the Arabic world. Revolutions in these countries started after acts of resistance on the infamous local streets and squares. Just like the Iranian protests of 2009, the Arabic Spring got captured by citizens using their cell phones. The images subsequently got dispersed on the internet through social media, being the only visual sources of these events when international media were denied access by the totalitarian authorities.\r\n\r\nThe burdened locations of Tehran in \'nocturne #2\' are interchangeable with those of the Arabic countries, since they are just shown as a scenery, in fixed camera shots, with minimal activity and without sound. From the idea of the absent, the over-mediated images are disposed from their sensational content, their manipulative representation, and their historical referent even.

Everything happens before, during and after the shootings of his first feature. Itâ€™s a sequence of events which reflect the difficulties, frustrations, the joy, the eccentricity and how tragic can the work of a team, made mainly by finalists of a cinema school, be.\r\n\r\nShowing an open mind and an enormous will to make cinema, JoÃ£o, the production director, Jaime, the sound director, and Pedro the photography director join Rita, the directorâ€™s assistant and Victor the image assistant and rush themselves, along with Miguel into this cause in which almost only they believe in.\r\n\r\nTo finance his project Miguel sends letters to enterprises and City Halls asking for all kinds of entities that can contribute with money for their sponsoring. In return he would put their products in scenes of the film or mentions about the sponsors would be made.\r\n\r\nMiguel leads the destiny of his team almost intuitively, aiming to materialize a cinematographic experience using very thin material and financial resources. To prove it, is the fact that theyâ€™re using 16 mm film, considered a very limitative format and therefor, cheaper.\r\n\r\nAround Miguel are all that constitute his team and follow him around, sharing some of his will to make this great project come true. Each one of them has a dream and faces it with kind of fascination. There is an almost heroic feeling of conquest when facing the difficulties that rise all the time. The shooting team tries to exceed itself, being this the only way to win the several setbacks which tests everyoneâ€™s persistence.\r\n\r\nDuring his shootings we can see Miguelâ€™s inner journey, during which, a sequence of events happen affecting inexorably the rest of the team. The notion of this journey is explicit in the constant ramble between different destinations â€“ resembling the ways of a nomad tribe â€“ Lisbon, Figueira da Foz, Alentejo, Paris and Venice. Venice is probably the most intimate destiny, due to its peculiar ambience characterized by sounds and tonalities without resemblance.\r\n\r\nItâ€™s in fact in Venice that Miguel and Ana begin an emotional involvement. On the other hand there are some moments of enormous stress due to several technical problems which provoke the inevitable confrontations: during the first shootings in Venice the camera breaks down putting the continuation of the project at risk, along with the fact that Miguel made the trip without money, causing an enormous embarrassment to the entire team. This situation makes them start all over again, this time with a new leading actress, a new Ana.\r\n\r\nMiguel shoots his film and at the same time, he makes promotional videos to get funds which allow him to achieve his aims. In this wander around the world, there is an entire sequence of moments which reflect the day by day of those who have a passion for cinema. But it is the Parisian cold that precedes the car accident involving Miguel, Pedro, Jaime, Victor, Rita, JosÃ© and Ana, who dies as a result of the accident.\r\n\r\nThis is when Miguel suffers an emotional shock and decides to end the project. There is an exhibition in a provincial theatre and the film that was supposed to be called â€œColoured Friendshipsâ€ but end up named â€œ1st Time 16mmâ€. Whatâ€™s the price to pay for a â€œhappy endâ€?...',339,'prijave/2011/slike/1350828909.jpeg','prijave/2011/slike/1350828910.jpeg','prijave/2011/slike/1350828911.jpeg','BIOGRAPHY\r\n\r\nRui Goulart was born in Luanda â€“ Angola on the 16th of May 1962.\r\nRui Goulart studied Theatre at the Portuguese Conservatory, in Lisbon â€“ Portugal.\r\nLater he decided to go to France and study Cinema.\r\n   \r\n\r\nFILMOGRAFY\r\n\r\nSHORT CUTS\r\n\r\nâ€œINTERNATIONAL BOARDING HOUSEâ€ , 2002, short cut, filmed in Algarve â€“ Portugal.

Whilst the use of the record by post-punk band Joy Division [An Ideal For Living EP, 1978. from which the work takes its name] references another specific English social and historical period, which provides a potential for creating a ambiguous narrative or contextualisation of the hybrid characters, generating a contradictory dynamism to these lumbering figures.',42,'prijave/2011/slike/1306828056.jpeg','prijave/2011/slike/1306828057.jpeg','prijave/2011/slike/1306828058.jpeg','BIOGRAPHY JONATHAN KELHAM \r\n\r\nJonathan Kelham was born in1986, in the East Riding of Yorkshire, UK.

By rich and fascinating visual means, the film makes it possible to experience poetry in a different way and more approachable to the general public.\r\n\r\nThe film describes the cultural awakening taking place in recent years in the center of Jerusalem, the capital of Israel, which had been neglected physically and culturally before.\r\n\r\nIn May 2002, five Jerusalem poets meet in order to establish a feedback group: a forum in which they can discuss and improve their poems. One of the participants is Gilad Meiri, who changes matters to our discussions. He is not interested in publishing another poetry book. He dreams of breaking the glass ceiling of poetry by making it accessible to all. He is successful in breaking oppositions and unites the five in an active poetry group. Here starts their common journey: they become one poetic family who dreams that poetry will become as widespread as mobile phones.\r\n\r\nThe poems of these five people â€“ clear, humoristic and exciting â€“ become part of their joint activities: Dorit reads poetry in a supermarket; Gilad launches an anthology in Teddy Football Stadium, thus conquering new audiences for their poetry. They establish the group at a center for culture, youth and sport in Jerusalem\'s Nahla\'ot, print poetry on envelopes and tax invoices and dream of reading poetry in hospitals and at the corridors of the Knesset â€“ in all those places which need compassion. They realize a dream of creating workshops for poetry writing for marginal groups in society. They wish poetry not only to speak but to make a change.\r\n\r\nHowever, after four years of activity, it seems their vision is still far from reality. In spite of their great efforts and dedication, personal conflicts and fund raising attempts, there are no results (\"there is no audience\"). Gilad Meiri does not despair. With determination and a healthy sense for bureaucracy he manages to generate a metamorphosis: the five poets gather strength, raise funds and become a kind of rock group which initiates and produces its own material. The group publishes a joint book and a periodical and becomes more and more influential in the field of poetry in Israel. The activities of the group comes to a climax in the production of the first poetry festival \"One Square Meter\" in the Jerusalem Mahaneh Yehuda Market. Will the audience come?\r\n\r\nThe film ends with the exciting success of the festival. In contrast to their initial fears, people from all over the country come to Jerusalem and fill up the sites of the various events; the group gains recognition, and it seems poetry finds its path back to people\'s hearts.',55,'prijave/2011/slike/1311113808.jpeg','prijave/2011/slike/1311113809.jpeg','prijave/2011/slike/1311113810.jpeg','DORIT WEISMAN \r\nDirector, poet and translator.

Four protagonists have been portrayed giving very personal views on the toy itself and its significant influence on their work, the Do-It-Yourself culture in skateboarding, the rules of the industry and the aging process. Skateboarding once pushed these guys to create things that people wouldn\'t necessarily link to this object, leading to the question whether this passion can be considered a subculture.   \r\n\r\nThe protagonists in this densely filmed full length documentary are the photographer Adam Sello from Berlin, Artist and Designer Stefan Marx from Hamburg, concrete avantgardist and filmmaker Pontus Alv from MalmÃ¶ and the urban artefact-collector Bobby Puleo from New York. They have been followed for several days and weeks, giving insights in their everyday life, their work, their motives, their successes and  failures.

Still, to those who are willing to look beyond the statistics, this town reveals its beauty. In particular, this documentary shows a multicultural and convivial dream come true. Four protagonists from entirely different backgrounds and origins and a donkey, all inhabitants of this surrealistic town, mount a terril (slag heap) and discover the beauty of their habitat. At the summit they are surprised by the resurrection of singer Claude FranÃ§ois, the French singing legend who passed away in an accident just a few years after La LouviÃ¨re\'s last mine was closed down.',98,'prijave/2011/slike/1315945703.jpeg','prijave/2011/slike/1315945704.jpeg','prijave/2011/slike/1315945705.jpeg','Antoon Cox was born in Leuven, Belgium (1980).

An \"impossible body\" is enacting a fantasy of loss and distance, i.e. also a fantasy of desire. It thus leaves open the question, and of a feminine position in relation to it, refusing, to \"answer\" it with an assured, static, monolithic definition of the \"nature\" of both masculine and feminine desire, of desire itself. Our Western thinking is always entrapped in binary dichotomies. But even inside the prison, we may find tools to get free. Not just through an escapist imagination, but actual contra-diction. Through the body, subject/object, metaphor and matter, form and content, identity and difference. The chiasm between the private and the public. The body is written, but can speak also. Playing with quotes or idioms, trying to disclose a new sense, impling also nosense. Filling some gaps, some silences, some vanishing points, left out parenthesis; nowhere now here (at the beginning of the video) means in this hic et nunc, which is always ineffable. The present is captive, between past and future. Towards the end of the video an inter-text says peek a boo-merang, referring to past and future space-time dimensions in an ironic way. Irony turns everything upsidedown and so opens up new perspectives. It was meant to finish like a hang-woman game. But it is not an end in itself, the game is open. To you, the other, the referent. And the inter-text the end is in a big bubble, a vanitas vanitatae; to remind us that life is death, but also that death is life.',99,'prijave/2011/slike/1315985864.jpeg','prijave/2011/slike/1315985865.jpeg','prijave/2011/slike/1315985866.jpeg','Degree in Preservation of Cultural Heritage.

Meaning is conventionally above, but non reacheable because the triangle is open and irregular. In the section below we have a door that disappears, reappears, it is in between. The door divides but is also a threshold: it can open up or shut down. Even if this dialogue between the two identities is always interrupted, it eventually seems more vital: it is the only tension. The woman is the object of the male gaze, but she tries to be subject as well, with up and downs, but never crawling; she wrappes herself in a closed triangle in the above split, ignoring the observer. Downwards, she looks into the camera. She sees herself, a medusean matrix. She shakes her hand in the end.

Da li napadnim pokuÅ¡avanjem da se odrÅ¾i plamen ljubavi moÅ¾emo uzrokovati brÅ¾e gaÅ¡enje vatre i onda za to okrivite druge.

Chartier explores the sense of confinement that many people feel living in large\r\ncities despite the many people around them. The piece, created using manipulated footage shot\r\nthroughout NYC, consists of textures comprised of feedback loops uplinked to satellites then downlinked\r\nback to Earth. These â€œfeedback loopsâ€ were manipulated with various pieces of broadcast\r\nequipment through the looping process and were then further manipulated in the post production\r\nprocess. The textures and manipulated footage were then woven together to create this work.\r\nThe musical component of this work was created through the use of a granular sampling algorithm\r\ndeveloped by the composer, Paul J. Botelho The algorithm, written in the ChucK programming\r\nlanguage, randomly chooses small fragments (grains) from an input sound, shapes their attack and\r\ndecay, and then creates textures of user-specified density constructed of the sound fragments. The\r\nalgorithmically-generated textures were then manipulated and layered to create this work.\r\nThe piece was created through synchronicityâ€”the composer Botelho and video artist Chartier had no\r\nknowledge of each other\'s component and worked only with an agreed upon duration during the\r\ncreation of their individual pieces.

His work in the Video Art Medium explores multiple layers and focuses\r\nheavily on texture and color.

He performs as a vocalist, guitarist,\r\nand pianist, often in improvisatory situations. Botelho has composed and performed a series of one-act\r\noperas that incorporate live acoustic instruments and electronic components. These works encompass\r\nall of his varied disciplines and represent the breadth of his work. He received his Ph.D. in Music\r\nComposition from Princeton University, M.A. in Electro-Acoustic Music from Dartmouth College, and\r\nB.F.A in Contemporary Music Composition and Performance from the College of Santa Fe.

The village, hitherto famous mostly for its sauerkraut and the â€œRadegastâ€ beer was thus turned into an industrial zone â€“ the largest greenfield investment project in the Czech Republicâ€™s history. Nonetheless, for a long time many farmers resisted selling the land upon which the factory was now standing. Eventually, they all succumbed under the pressure from the neighbours, and even the anonymous death threats. The filmmakers returned to NoÅ¡ovice two years after the dramatic property buyouts, at the time when the factory has just started churning out cheap cars. Combining the perspectives of seven characters, they have composed a portrayal of a place suddenly changed beyond recognition that is playful and chilling at the same time: a politically engaged absurd flick about a field that yields cars.',204,'prijave/2011/slike/1317657681.bmp','prijave/2011/slike/1317657682.jpeg','prijave/2011/slike/1317657683.jpeg','VÃt KlusÃ¡k (*1980) \r\nGraduate of the Department of Documentary Film at FAMU (Film and Television School of the Academy of Performing Arts) Prague, since 2005 he has been teaching in the same department (â€˜Film Narrationâ€™ seminar).

Thatâ€™s the premise of this docu-fiction, which was shot entirely on a cell phone. In order to break through the wall of urban anonymity, the filmmaker talks to various people on the streets of London, out of whom three main characters materialize: a Brazilian beauty named Sandrine, whoâ€™s looking for a husband, a drug addict named Steve, and Precious, a singer and poetess. There is no script: what begins as a vague idea gradually metamorphoses into a confusing project, and filmmaker Boris Gerrets begins to have grave doubts about his own role in all of this. When he ends up having an affair with Sandrine, he goes from observer to participant in his own film. The camera would seem to be an aphrodisiac, but the closer he gets to his subject, the more the camera gets in his way. At the same time, things happen that would never have been possible without the camera. Filming creates one moment while simultaneously destroying another. According to Gerrets, that is the paradox that defines cinemaâ€™s relationship to reality. Meanwhile, Steve drinks to numb the pain of loneliness. He wants life so badly that he botches it all up.',206,'prijave/2011/slike/1317653971.jpeg','prijave/2011/slike/1317653972.jpeg','prijave/2011/slike/1317653973.jpeg','Boris Gerrets is an internationally acclaimed documentary filmmaker who lives and works between London and Amsterdam. He is also an accomplished visual artist and film-editor. Born into a Bulgarian-German family, he grew-up in the Netherlands, Spain, Sierra Leone and Germany. Boris Gerretsâ€™ films are close-ups of local environments, which he describes as â€˜biotopic explorationsâ€™. He delves into the anonymity of the urban space, bringing to light life on the fringes, which often remains obscure to the passing person. This leads him to unexpected encounters that drive the narrative of his films. Gerrets sees the camera as a tool that creates a social dynamic between him and his protagonists. The editing process is for Gerrets a way of stripping down and reconfiguring what has been garnered in reality, into a phenomenological space that speaks about the human condition. His role as filmmaker and the process of filmmaking is always at issue - either implicitly or explicitly - while he intentionally explores the gap between the factual event and its fictional and poetic meaning. Gerretsâ€™ cinematic approach contains a strong performative component and relies heavily on his multidisciplinary background in fine arts, dance and theatre. He is the recipient of a number of grants and has toured and shown his work internationally in museum and gallery exhibitions and video and film festivals. Gerretsâ€™ most recent film, People I Could Have Been and Maybe Am (2010) received the IDFA Best Mid-Length Doc Award, BELDOCS FIPRESCI Award, HOTDOCS Honorable Mention, VISIONS DU RÃ‰EL Best Direction Mid-Length Doc, TIME OUT Best City Film Award London,  PÃ„RNU DOCUMENARY FILM FESTIVAL Most Innovatice Documentary and DOKUFEST award in Prizren Kosovo. \r\nBoris Gerrets has toured and shown his work internationally in exhibitions, film and video festivals: Stedelijk Museum, Amsterdam 1986; documenta 8 Kassel (Cloud Chamber) 1987; FundaÃ§Ã£o Calouste Gulbenkian Lissbon 1989; Springdance Utrecht 1988/90; Centre d\'Art Contemporain, Caen; Videopositive, Tate Gallery Liverpool 1995; Impact Festival, Utrecht 1995/96/98; Kiasma Museum of Modern Art, Helsinki 2002; Nederlands Film Festival Utrecht (2003/4/6); International Documentary Filmfestival Amsterdam 2006.

In multiple iterations, I explore the effect of landscape on sound by sending the bullhorn, playing at full volume, down this zipline from one location to another as a way to use sound to define those places, and collectively generate an acoustic map of the landscape. I have choreographed the footage so that different locations play side-by-side, harmonizing the countryâ€™s landscape. As a sculptor, I am interested in treating sound as a tangible material despite its fleeting nature, and in this radio zipline as a whimsically foreign and manmade object on the rugged natural environment. The zipline allows the bullhorn to span â€œhollersâ€ and travel downward amongst rock walls, allowing me to explore how different confines and contours of the landscape, and the resulting flow of the wind, impact pitch.

Logistically, I am equipped with custom-made harnesses that support a thousand feet of cable, allowing me to form a nomadic zipline that easily fastens from my torso that of another, or the trunk of a tree, without damaging the environment. In multiple iterations, I explore the effect of landscape on sound by sending the bullhorn, playing at full volume, down this zipline from one location to another as a way to use sound to define those places, and collectively generate an acoustic map of the landscape. I have choreographed the footage so that different locations play side-by-side, harmonizing the countryâ€™s landscape. As a sculptor, I am interested in treating sound as a tangible material despite its fleeting nature, and in this radio zipline as a whimsically foreign and manmade object on the rugged natural environment. The zipline allows the bullhorn to span â€œhollersâ€ and travel downward amongst rock walls, allowing me to explore how different confines and contours of the landscape, and the resulting flow of the wind, impact pitch. My process also allows me to capture the Doppler effect as the sound source travels fluidly past audio/video recording devices.',306,'prijave/2011/slike/1318692124.jpeg','prijave/2011/slike/1318692125.jpeg','prijave/2011/slike/1318692126.jpeg','I approach art as an opportunity to fold levels of reality together that are traditionally kept apart. Frequently this means pushing traditional materials (such as clay, ink, and fabric) and aesthetic values (such as scale) into innovative zones. At times I incorporate my physical body into my work to discover its pliability in the face of conditioning and constraints imposed by society, and to ascertain the limits of my own self-control. I build impossibility into my work to develop false hope, and thereby question the notion of success. Yet while my works are often explorations in futility, processes and outcomes that are seemingly senseless are never wasted when followed by meaningful insight, as I realize that it is the process of unlearning that is of ultimate worth. My artistic activity is spread across a diversity of projects in order to address a broad spectrum, and in asserting space for the individual, I aim to trigger a fresh and multifaceted awareness in the viewer.','Sat, 15 Oct 2011 03:43:44 +020'),('Lighthouse Polka ','Lighthouse Polka','Neil Ira Needleman','United States','international',2011,'05:32','dvd ','none','Neil Ira Needleman','Neil Ira Needleman','none','none','','Neil Ira Needleman','21-40 Croton Lake Road, Katona','','','nneedleman@gmail.com','Neil Ira Needleman','','','nneedleman@gmail.com','Oom-pah, oom-pah.

Although the subject concerns poverty in Eastern Germany, no one in front of the camera is explicitly identified as poor.\r\nA woman about whom we know little, and only see her apartment, guides us through the film without speaking. Her feelings are expressed to us by the manner of how and where she moves. On the one hand, she is a projection surface, while escaping simple explanations and attributions on the other.\r\nThe strategy for approaching the subject is comparison. â€œDie Arbeitslosen von Marienthalâ€ (The Unemployed of Marienthal) â€“ a study about unemployment and poverty in a small Austrian village, which was published at the beginning of the 1930s â€“ is read aloud by a male speaking voice. The voice-over simultaneously appears as writing on pixelated old photographs, in which poverty, as we would envision it in our heads, can be seen as a clichÃ©. During this era, the poor went hungry and froze; they had no shoes and no extra clothes. Through the alternation of present-day images and the integration of clips of interviews, which we conducted with the non-poor about poverty, it becomes apparent that our generationâ€™s problems caused by poverty are different than those at the beginning of the 20th century. Even the animation in the opening credits â€“ flirting with revolution and a revolt of the poor â€“ exposes a clichÃ©, with which we can go no further.\r\nIn the end, loss of a sense of time, resignation and lethargy â€“ conditions, which are also described in the Marienthal study â€“ are what remain as findings about poverty. The film slows down and everything begins to blur.\r\nImages of the non-poor, of the so-called norm, are shown again and again. As a group, they senselessly celebrate and consume. They repress and compensate by consumption. Today, this prospect of displacement through consumption is not available to the poor. This exclusion of the poor from society is not from a public space (which no longer exists), but rather from a consumer society in which people define themselves by their optimal consumption in private.',300,'prijave/2011/slike/1318619496.jpeg','prijave/2011/slike/1318619497.jpeg','prijave/2011/slike/1318619498.jpeg','JUDITH SIEGMUND, *1965 (GERMANY) IS VIDEOARTIST AND PHILOSOPHER.

The film is a revisiting of the future, i.e., it refers to a â€˜tomorrowâ€™ which has already gone by: rather than a historical reconstruction, it is the investigation of a place immersed in a ghostly atmosphere, amidst the exuberance of nature re-conquering space and objects, and traces of the past lives of people. The appeal of the ruins and the depth of the meaning of which they are the bearers, are set up against the far-away, suffering voices of the inhabitants of once upon a time. \r\nProduction: Zavod Kinoatelje and Kinoatelje, co-produced by â€œIvan Trinkoâ€, a cultural club\r\nPrizes: â€œVesnaâ€ for special merits at the XI  Slovenian Film Festival (2008)\r\n\r\n2006\r\nTHE MAN FROM STREGNA (L\'uomo di Stregna / ÄŒlovek iz Srednjega)\r\nCoordination of  various activities - the philological recovery, conservative restoration (in collaboration with the â€œLa Camera Otticaâ€ laboratory, the University of Udine â€“ DAMS Degree Course) and the remake, with new editing work - of the 8mm film titled â€œThe Man from Stregnaâ€ (1963), directed by Paolo Rojatti. \r\nProduction: Centro Studi Nediza / â€œIvan Trinkoâ€, a cultural club / Kinoatelje.\r\n\r\n2003\r\nSTARMI CAJT . THE STEEP TIME\r\nDirection of the film, which employs super-8 images and a photographic report by father Paolo on the small towns and villages in the Valleys of the Natisone, most struck by the 1976 earthquake. Through these â€œhistoricâ€ images, current images and oral testimonies linked to the catastrophic event â€“ the seism â€“, we are led to a reflection on the overpowering, social and environmental changes which, over the last few decades, have involved the rural areas of our land.\r\nProduction: â€œIvan Trinkoâ€, a cultural club. Distribution: Kinoatelje.\r\n\r\n1998\r\nSARCE OD HIÅ E (The Heart of the House)\r\nDirection of the film which, through super-8 images produced by father Paolo in 1974 and current testimonies, proposes once again the foremost moments of the traditional festivals linked to popular devoutness in the Valleys of the Natisone.

She works on presenting it using means which are invented and complement each other as the works are developed in video (Bouquet Final, 2005), musical performances (Quartet for Solo Cello, 2008), scenography (Nuages Insolubles, 2009), sound installations (Decomposed Orchestra 2007, Le Repos du Crieur Public, 2011) and internet-based audiovisual projects (Public Address System, 2009).','Tue, 11 Oct 2011 13:14:56 +020'),('Una birra a Venezia ','','Å½eljko Radivoj','Hrvatska','jugoslavia',2011,'1','min dv ','Å½eljko Radivoj','Å½eljko Radivoj','Å½eljko Radivoj','','Arhivska','','KK Zagreb-SF i Hrvatski filmsk','Zagreb, TuÅ¡kanac 1','385014848771','','zeljko@hfs.hr','Å½eljko Radivoj','091 3783783','','zeljko@hfs.hr','U predahu jedna piva u Veneciji.',320,'prijave/2011/slike/1318909442.jpeg','prijave/2011/slike/1318909443.jpeg','prijave/2011/slike/1318909444.jpeg','RoÄ‘en 1948. u Slavoniji.U Zagrebu  Å¾ivi i Å¡koluje se od 1961.

A mafia clan decides to adapt an old-school communication tool to convey confidential information. The supposedly superb idea is to send encoded postcards so that the people involved have to get their hands dirty. Late at night all cards are hidden in public dustbins, where - in the middle of fast-food leftovers and free newspapers - they discretely wait for their recipient. While the mafia bosses are rubbing their manicured hands sure of victory, an unnoticed mischief-maker disrupts their plans. By unintentionally dispersing the valuable postcards on a regular basis a tramp starts driving the mafiosi insane after a short time. The bosses suspect having a mole within themselves. Because who else other than their own messenger could be responsible for the failure of their plan?\r\nPostcard-Mafia tells the grotesque story of a group of people, who is obsessed with a brilliant idea.

Once part of a larger Armenia, mount Ararat is now located in Turkey. Since 1920, after the Armenian genocide, it\'s just behind the closed border with Turkey, still dominating the Armenian landscape. But Armenians can only gaze at it with longing.\r\n\r\nIn \'relocation\' the sun rises over the Ararat valley, with the monumental Ararat twin mountains in the back. Starting from a nearly pitch black image the landscape exposes slowly, revealing human life around the military controlled no man\'s land, buffering both nations. It is the landscape as seen from Armenia, at the closest accessible point to the border with Turkey. Only, the image is mirrored. Left and right are reversed, implying the impossible view (for Armenians) of the Western side of the mountain. That\'s how \'relocation\' refers to an era long gone, when historical Armenia still was one, or quite to an era Armenians wish for it to be. In this video the mountains are dislocated, as have been the Armenian people. \r\n\r\nA dialoguing text comments on the landscape, as subtitles to a film. As if both mountains are in dialogue with each other, it \r\nis mainly a dialogue between two nations, with historical, political, biblical and utopical connotations. This text is based on testimonies and eyewitnesses from both sides of the mountain, going back to the early 20th century and referring to a turbulent era and tense relations between Turkey and Armenia. \r\n\'relocation\' reflects on identity in general, and the Armenian identity in particular. How and to what extent does Mount Ararat (still) define Armenian identity?

In this work of memory and self-awareness, Engelmann questions her family background and cultural origin on various different levels. Investigative directed documentary material from the past 10 years and other found footage are carefully weaved with super-8 family footage to tell her personal story growing up in the vanishing â€žDanube Swabianâ€œ culture. The film focuses on the concept of home as either a simple geographical place or as a more complex inner, emotional place and it deals with the sociological question how knowledge is produced and achieved in society and the concept of pictorial memory build-up. Exactly how much of the latter is real is not addressed, however. \r\n\r\nMovement within the film is both metaphorical and physical: not only representing the motion of time within history, but also using interludes of dance for physically expressing cultural concepts. Engelmann is not just travelling within her personal story and interviewing family members and an antropologist of the â€žDanube Swabian Museumâ€œ in Ulm, she is even travelling to a danube swabian colony in Brasil. It`s the last place on the world people are still speaking the same danube swabian dialect as Engelmannâ€™s greatgrandmother did. A Manual to Change the Past is both, a philosophical and a humurous film. It ends with the attempt to transfer cultural roots into the present and invites us, the audience, to a dance in traditional clothes in a club in Berlin.',410,'prijave/2011/slike/1319813744.jpeg','prijave/2011/slike/1319813745.jpeg','prijave/2011/slike/1319813746.jpeg','bio:    the film maker and artist antje engelmann lives and works in berlin. she studied visual arts at the udk berlin and at the faculdade de belles artes de barcelona. she is with her awarded multimedial work represented internationally. in addition to her social and political engagement she teaches european media science at the university/fh potsdam.\r\n\r\nfilmography:\r\n\r\n2010 -Storys, loop, Experimentalfilm           \r\n            -Das Licht kommt aus der Lausitz, 18 min.

The Wroclaw-based group Karbido, famous for its cutting-edge projects like the recent album recorded with the Ukrainian poet Yuri Andrukhovich, had the courage to do so â€” the courage and the skills. THE TABLE has been subtitled as â€žA MAPLE SWISH-AND-SHUSHâ€œ. The show abounds in swishes and shushes, indeed, and the attributive adjective â€žmapleâ€œ will obviously refer to the protagonist of the performance, i.e. the table. A piece of instrument, when properly stuffed, has become a real instrument: the sound that the musicians produce from it takes your breath away. The techniques of their musical performance vary from fondling the table, tapping and patting it, stroking and brushing through shuffling glasses,  whirling coins on its surface and cutting it with razor-sharp blades to plucking the initially hidden strings. The show is an hour-long symphony of sounds, varied   as to their style and atmosphere from hard rock through African drums and club rhythms to vocally embellished Mongolian songs and Eskimo-like rhythmical structures based on human breath. And, hard as it is to imagine, this is how Karbido plays Hendrixâ€™s Hey Joe!\"\r\nJoanna Ruszczyk, NEWSWEEK 48/2006',425,'prijave/2011/slike/1320075406.jpeg','prijave/2011/slike/1320075407.jpeg','prijave/2011/slike/1320075408.jpeg','CINEMATOGRAPHER:          \r\n1.
